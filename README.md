Our plan is to train a machine model using a dataset of NBA player statistics (in the Resources folder) in the hope that our model will be able to accurately predict the individual players rankings in the league. We will then compare our models results with the rankings in the games NBA 2K in order to test our models accuracy. We are planning on just focusing on the top 100 players, but we will expand this to more players if viable. The model will most likely be a supervised model and will be using python for the code.
