 ## Outline 
 
We are planning to use the NBA dataset included to analyze real player stats in comparison to the NBA 2k20 video game. Basketball players in the video game are given a ranking based on over 50 different factors, according to developers of the game. 
 
Our goal is to design a machine learning model that will closely predict what ranking players will be given in the game based on the provided statistics. 

We plan to limit our analysis to the top 100 ranked players for the season, but have discussed opening this range further if needed. 

## Tools and Techniques

* Python: data preprocessing, machine learning model 
* Postgres: data storing
* HTML and Java: building visualizations and a dashboard 

## Challenges 

Personally, I foresee my biggest challenge being that there is not as much structure in this project, so in needing to find ways to make that for myself and create personal checkpoints. 

As a group, we've talked a lot about expecting our data questions and even the scope of our data to change as we go further into the project.
