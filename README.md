Our plan is to train a machine model using a dataset of NBA player statistics (in the Resources folder) in the hope that our model will be able to accurately predict the individual players rankings in the league. We will then compare our models results with the rankings in the games NBA 2K in order to test our models accuracy. We are planning on just focusing on the top 100 players, but we will expand this to more players if viable. The model will most likely be a supervised model and will be using python for the code. 

For our database we are planning on using Postgres and will most likely dislay the results on a webpage using Javascript and HTML. For challenges, the most difficult for me will just be working without a roadmap as all of the challenges have provided to steps in order to accomplish the task. One concern we had in our intital discussion was if there will be enough work for the whole group, and if we wanted to expand on our intial idea, how would go about doing that. That covers our first week of the group project. All of the groups members are really nice and I look forward to working with them over the next few weeks!
